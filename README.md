ChatGPT Sentence Polisher - Chrome Extension

A Chrome extension to effortlessly polish your sentences using OpenAI's ChatGPT. It helps you turn casual sentences into more professional, polished statements with just a few clicks!

Features:
- Polish your sentences: Input a casual or rough sentence, and get a professional version generated by ChatGPT.
- Simple Interface: Two input boxes — one for your sentence, one for the polished output.
- API Key Integration: Save your OpenAI API key directly in the settings.
- No Backend: Everything happens locally on your machine using Chrome Storage API.
- Real-time Feedback: Get immediate results with clear status updates.

Getting Started:

1. Clone or Download the Repository
   - Clone this repository or download the ZIP file from GitHub.

     git clone https://github.com/your-username/chatgpt-sentence-polisher.git

2. Get Your OpenAI API Key
   - To use this extension, you need an OpenAI API key:
     - Visit https://platform.openai.com/
     - Log in or create an account.
     - Navigate to API Keys under Manage Account.
     - Create a new secret key and copy it.

3. Install the Extension in Chrome
   - Open Chrome and go to chrome://extensions/.
   - Enable Developer Mode (toggle in the top-right).
   - Click on Load unpacked and select the folder where you saved this project.
   - The extension should now appear in your Chrome toolbar!

4. Set Your API Key
   - Click on the extension icon in your browser.
   - Go to the Settings page.
   - Paste your OpenAI API key in the provided input box and click Save.

How It Works:
- Input Box: Type or paste your sentence that needs polishing.
- Output Box: The polished, professional version will appear immediately after the API processes your request.
- Settings: Manage your OpenAI API key securely in the settings page.

Important Notes:
- You must provide your own OpenAI API key to use the extension.
- OpenAI API may incur costs depending on usage. Keep track of your usage through the OpenAI platform.
- The extension uses local storage (Chrome Storage API) to save your API key. It doesn't send your data to any server.

Future Enhancements:
- Customizable Output Styles: Choose between formal, casual, or even humorous tone.
- Dark Mode: For those who prefer working in the dark (theme, not mood).
- Additional Features: Slang detection, multi-language support, and more!
